                            ou’ve heard chatter about bootcamps, read about how much developers earn, and seen tech startups valued at a billion dollars. Everyone’s talking about how coding is the future, and you’re thinking about checking it out for yourself — maybe even considering a career change.

                            Code is just the translation of logic into a format that a machine can interpret. “I want to see all the rows in this database table” becomes SELECT * FROM table1. It’s just a formalised version of the logic, in the vocabulary and syntax of the language. It’s the implementation level of tech.
